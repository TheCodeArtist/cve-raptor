# CVE-Raptor #

Monitor CVE announcements and automatically notify when a binary/package/library/domain is affected.

# How to run cve-raptor?

> Download one of the CVE announcements (in CVRF format) from  
> https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/index.html
>
> For example [**allitems-cvrf.xml**](https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/allitems-cvrf.xml)(~120MB) contains details of ~85,000 CVEs as of 10 NOV 2015.
>
> Update `cvrf_path` in `cve-prev-date.py` to point to the local copy of the downloaded CVRF XML file.

Running MVP build on Ubuntu 15.10:  
`$ python3 cve-prev-date.py`

...and voila...

![cve-raptor-MVP-2](/references/images/cve-raptor-MVP-2.png/?raw=true)


Also verified to work using python 3.4.3 on Windows 7.

# How CVE-Raptor works...

> *The following is the proposed workflow.*  
> *Currently individual functions are being implemented.*  
> *A MVP that supports phases 2, 3 & 4 is available as **`cve-prev-date.py`**.*


1. Fetches the CVRF header and checks whether the timestamp is newer than the previous run when it was fetched.

2. If the header indicates that a newer CVRF is available, then the entire CVRF is fetched and a copy is saved locally.

3. The local copy of the latest CVRF is then parsed for all published/modified vulnerabilities(CVEs) since the previous run.

4. Results are displayed immediately on the console.

5. Optionally specific keyword(s) related to a binary/library/package/domain can be searched for in the newly published/modified CVEs. Upon finding a match, notifications can be triggerred to the respective user(s) for example via email.

# Why "Raptor" ? #

**Raptors are famous for their**
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_vision" target="_blank">excellent eyesight</a> for finding food,
- strong feet for holding food,
- and a strong curved beak for tearing flesh.

**CVE-raptor hopes to demonstrate similar agility in**
- quickly searching,
- filtering,
- and identifying CVEs of interest from public database(s).
